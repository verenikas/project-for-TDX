# Introduction to Cybersecurity in IT

## Definition of Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity involves protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, damage, or theft.

## Importance
- Protects sensitive data (personal, financial, and corporate information)
- Maintains the integrity and availability of IT systems and networks
- Prevents financial losses due to cybercrime
- Protects the reputation and trust of businesses and organizations

## Current Landscape
- Increasing sophistication and frequency of cyber attacks
- Growing reliance on digital technologies
- Rising costs associated with data breaches

## Common Cybersecurity Threats
### Malware
- **Viruses:** Programs that replicate themselves and spread to other files and systems.
- **Worms:** Self-replicating programs that spread without human intervention.
- **Ransomware:** Malicious software that encrypts data and demands ransom for decryption keys.

### Phishing
- Deceptive attempts to obtain sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity via email, messages, or websites.

### Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
- Overloading systems, servers, or networks to disrupt normal traffic and render them unusable.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
- Eavesdropping or altering communications between two parties without their knowledge.

### Insider Threats
- Malicious actions or negligence by employees or other insiders with access to the organizationâ€™s systems and data.

### Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- Prolonged and targeted cyber attacks aimed at stealing data or surveilling activities without detection.

## Cybersecurity Best Practices
- **Strong Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Using complex passwords and adding an extra layer of security with MFA.
- **Regular Software Updates:** Ensuring systems and applications are up to date to patch vulnerabilities.
- **Employee Training:** Educating employees on recognizing and responding to cyber threats.
- **Network Security Measures:** Implementing firewalls, IDS/IPS, and data encryption.
- **Backups and Disaster Recovery:** Regularly backing up data and having a recovery plan in place.

## Cybersecurity Frameworks and Standards
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
- **ISO/IEC 27001:** International standard for information security management systems.
- **CIS Controls:** Set of best practices to defend against common cyber threats.

## Regulatory Requirements
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** EU regulation for data protection and privacy.
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act):** State law enhancing privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California.

## Cybersecurity Technologies
- **Antivirus and Anti-Malware**
- **SIEM Systems**
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
- **Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)**

## Incident Response and Management
- **Incident Response Planning:** Developing a clear plan to identify, manage, and recover from cybersecurity incidents.
- **Handling an Incident:** Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned.

## Emerging Trends in Cybersecurity
- AI and Machine Learning
